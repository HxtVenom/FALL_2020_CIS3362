1. 

2.  Created program to decrypt Vigenere Cipher. The program takes in a command (1 for Encrypt, 2 for Decrypt),
    the desired text, and for decryption it asks for the number of keys you wish to try. It then loops through
    the keys and decrypts the text provided with each key that can then be output to a file. This is a sort of
    brute force attempt at decryption and allows the user to provide the dictionary.

    Key found: investment
    Plaintext: normally_vigenere_is_challenging_to_break_but_since_i_gave_you_both_a_list_of_possible_keywords_
               and_something_to_look_for_in_the_plaintext_you_should_be_able_to_automate_this_get_the_key_and_
